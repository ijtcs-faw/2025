<b>Keynote 1:</b> Xiaoming Sun. Some mathematical problems in quantum circuit synthesis and optimization
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
Quantum circuits, serving as the foundational mathematical framework for quantum algorithm design, have become one of the key research areas in the field of quantum computing. As the field transitions beyond the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the synthesis and optimization of quantum circuits have emerged as critical challenges. While classical circuit complexity primarily focuses on minimizing size and depth, the complexity of quantum circuits demands a multi-objective approach encompassing additional metrics involving the number of auxiliary qubits, different energy levels used, and many other aspects. In this talk, we will discuss a series of new problems and recent research progress in quantum circuit compression, and explore theoretical connections between these problems and classical important problems such as Babai's conjecture about the diameter of Cayley graphs.

<b>Forum 1-1.</b> Penghui Yao. On the Computational Power of QAC0 with Barely Superlinear Ancillae
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
$\mathrm{QAC}^0$ is the family of constant-depth polynomial-size quantum circuits consisting of arbitrary single qubit unitaries and multi-qubit Toffoli gates. It was introduced by Moore [arXiv: 9903046] as a quantum counterpart of $\mathrm{AC}^0$, along with the conjecture that $\mathrm{QAC}^0$ circuits can not compute PARITY. In this work we make progress on this longstanding conjecture: we show that any depth-$d$ $\mathrm{QAC}^0$ circuit requires $n^{1+3^{-d}}$ ancillae to compute a function with approximate degree $\Theta(n)$, which includes PARITY, MAJORITY and $\mathrm{MOD}_k$. This is the first superlinear lower bound on the size of the ancillae required for computing parity. We further establish superlinear lower bounds on quantum state synthesis and quantum channel synthesis. These lower bounds are derived by giving low-degree approximations to $\mathrm{QAC}^0$ circuits. We show that a depth-$d$ $\mathrm{QAC}^0$ circuit with $a$ ancillae, when applied to low-degree operators, has a degree $(n+a)^{1-3^{-d}}$ polynomial approximation in the spectral norm. This implies that the class $\mathrm{QLC}^0$, corresponding to linear size $\mathrm{QAC}^0$ circuits, has approximate degree $o(n)$. This is a quantum generalization of the result that $\mathrm{LC}^0$ circuits have approximate degree $o(n)$ by Bun, Kothari, and Thaler [SODA 2019]. Our result also implies that $\mathrm{QLC}^0\neq\mathrm{NC}^1$.<br><br>

<b>Forum 1-2.</b> Bujiao Wu. State Similarity in Modular Superconducting Quantum Processors with Classical Communications
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
As quantum devices continue to scale, distributed quantum computing emerges as a promising strategy for executing large-scale tasks across modular quantum processors. A central challenge in this paradigm is verifying the correctness of computational outcomes when subcircuits are executed independently following circuit cutting. In this work, we propose a cross-platform fidelity estimation algorithm tailored for modular architectures. Our method achieves substantial reductions in sample complexity compared to previous approaches designed for single-processor systems. We experimentally implement the protocol on modular superconducting quantum processors with up to 6 qubits to verify the similarity of two 11-qubit GHZ states. Beyond verification, we show that our algorithm enables a federated quantum kernel method that preserves data privacy. As a proof of concept, we apply it to a 5-qubit quantum phase learning task using six 3-qubit modules, successfully extracting phase information with just eight training samples. These results establish a practical path for
scalable verification and trustworthy quantum machine learning of modular quantum processors.

<b>Forum 1-3.</b> Yiming Huang. Learning unitary process with autoregressive neural network
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Characterizing quantum processes is a cornerstone of quantum information science, but conventional techniques like quantum process tomography (QPT) demand extensive resources and suffer from poor scalability. Here, we propose a learning-based approach that leverages the generative model to efficiently learn Hamiltonian dynamics. By decomposing such dynamics into a linear combination of Pauli operators, with the expansion coefficients parameterized by an autoregressive neural network (ARNN), we design an infidelity loss and then train the ARNN to learn such unitary process. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed model offers a scalable and flexible pathway for characterizing quantum operations with potential applications in quantum computing and quantum information processing.<br><br>
Biography: Yiming Huang, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center on Frontiers of Computing Studies, Peking University, mainly focus on quantum algorithm and optimization for NISQ devices, and leveraging machine learning to tackle problems in quantum chemistry and many-body physics. His work aims to advance the application of quantum computing and machine learning in complex optimization and data processing.

Breaking the Sorting Barrier for Directed Single-Source Shortest Paths <br>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
We give a deterministic $O(m \log^{2/3} n)$-time algorithm for single-source shortest paths (SSSP) on directed graphs with real non-negative edge weights in comparison-addition model. This is the first result to break the $O(m + n \log n)$ time bound of Dijkstra algorithm on sparse graphs, showing that Dijkstra's algorithm is not optimal for SSSP.<br><br>
 
Biography: Xinkai Shu is a postdoctoral researcher at Max Planck Institute for Informatics. He obtained his PhD in Computer Science at The University of Hong Kong, supervised by Prof. Zhiyi Huang. Before that he obtained his bachelor's degree from Yao Class, Tsinghua University. His research interest is online algorithms, algorithmic game theory and fundamental graph algorithms.

Can You Link Up With Treewidth? <br> 
Jiaheng Wang <br>
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
In a fundamental paper in parameterized complexity theory, Marx constructed k-vertex graphs H of maximum degree 3 such that n^o(k/log k) time algorithms for detecting colorful H-subgraphs would refute the Exponential-Time Hypothesis (ETH). This result is widely used to obtain almost-tight conditional lower bounds for parameterized problems under ETH.

We give a new, fully self-contained and elementary proof of this result avoiding arguments involving expander graphs, which were required in previous papers. In our proof, we introduce a novel graph parameter of independent interest, the linkage capacity, and then use a simple construction of communication networks credited to Beneš to obtain such hard patterns.

Our technique only requires elementary divide-and-conquer arguments that feature in first-year undergraduate introduction courses to discrete mathematics and computer science.

This paper has appeared at STACS'25. Joint work with Radu Curticapean (Regensburg, ITU Copenhagen), Simon Döring (Saarland, MPI) and Daniel Neuen (MPI).

Biography: Jiaheng Wang is currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Regensburg. He worked as a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Edinburgh from 2023 to 2024. Prior to this, he obtained his PhD degree in 2023 from the University of Edinburgh, supervised by Dr. Heng Guo. Even earlier, he obtained his BSc degree (summa cum laude) in 2020 from Peking University as a member of the Turing Class. His research interest lies in multiple topics in theoretical computer science, with a focus on algorithms and complexity for counting problems.
