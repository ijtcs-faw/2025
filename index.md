## Overview

International Joint Conference on Theoretical Computer Science – Frontier of Algorithmic Wisdom (IJTCS-FAW 2025) will be held on Monday June 30 to Wednesday July 2, 2025, hosted by Sorbonne University, Paris, France. We aim to provide a platform for advancing theoretical computer science and promoting the exchange of knowledge and ideas. It is the 6th IJTCS and 19th FAW. 

IJTCS-FAW 2025 is calling for papers concerning any branch of theoretical computer science, together with focus tracks in Algorithm and Complexity, Algorithmic Game Theory, Automata Theory and Formal Languages, Blockchain, Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Computational Geometry, Formal Methods and Verification, Graph Theory and Algorithms, Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning, Network Economics, Parallel and Distributed Algorithms, Quantum Computation, Theoretical Aspects of Artificial Intelligence, Theory of Machine Learning. 

## Important dates

- Submission deadline: ~~29 January 2025~~ extended to 16 February 2025 (anywhere on earth)
- Notification: 20 March 2025
- Full version: 20 April 2025
- Conference dates: Monday June 30 to Wednesday July 2 (noon)


## Submission


Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract of no more than 12 pages, excluding references and the front page(s) (authors, affiliation, keywords, abstract, ...), presenting original research on the theory of computer science. Technical details necessary for a proper scientific evaluation of a submission must be included in the 12-page submission or in a clearly labelled appendix, to be consulted at the discretion of program committee members. Authors are encouraged to also make full versions of their submissions freely accessible in an online repository such as ArXiv.

Submissions must be formatted in the [LNCS style](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). All submission must be submitted via EasyChair using the following link:

[Submission link](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ijtcsfaw2025)

The proceedings of the conference will be published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series, and will be available for distribution at the conference. The use of pdflatex and the LNCS style is mandatory: papers that deviate significantly from the required format may be rejected without consideration of merit. No prior publication and no simultaneous submission to other conferences are allowed.

Papers will be reviewed according to the following tracks that includes
